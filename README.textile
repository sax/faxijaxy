h1. FaxiJaxy

This is a gem for Rails 3 that adds compatibility with the jquery.form plugin. That plugin requires that :js and :json responses to multi-part forms (i.e. file upload) be wrapped in a textarea.

This gem is pretty much just jaxy_file_uploads, reformatted as a gem and with Rails3 support.
